The number had always been consistently increasing every year, due to its popularity the demand of hotel is increasing. The average NYC hotel room rates start at $300 a night, because of its high price the Airbnb gave more options to the visitors who has limited budget to stay. The number of Airbnb in NYC grew every year because of its competitive pricing in the market.
