New York City had approximately 65.2 million visitors in 2018 and average of 60 million visitors for past five years. The number had always been consistently increasing every year, due to its popularity the demand of hotel is increasing. The average NYC hotel room rates start at $300 a night, because of its high price the Airbnb gave more options to the visitors who has limited budget to stay. The number of Airbnb in NYC grew every year because of its competitive pricing in the market. It currently has more than 50,000 apartment rental listing and average of 17,000 available rental listing every day. 

Our team decided to work on the New York City Air BNB 2019 data to give NYC visitors list of best Airbnb place and price options to stay in NYC. We want to find out following information; 

1.	Correlation between number of reviews and price 
2.	Which Neighborhood group has most air BNB  
3.	Average Price of Neighborhood Group 
4.	Owner of how many air BNB they listed on the website 

During the execution phase, our team could find out more data and if it helps the NYC
visitors to have the best experience staying in NYC within their budget. It will be add on to the final presentation.
